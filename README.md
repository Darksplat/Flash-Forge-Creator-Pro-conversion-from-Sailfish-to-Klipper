## Prerequisites

1. **Backup:** Before starting, back up configurations and settings from the current Sailfish firmware.

    ### FFCP Backup Firmware folder

    - **Firmware Backups [UNTESTED]:**
        I have not tried to restore said backups as I don't intend to go back to the Sailfish firmware.

    - **Atmega8U2 Folder:**
        Contains the firmware that acts like a USB to UART bridge and it also does the update of Sailfish firmware in a similar way as an ordinary Arduino.

    - **Atmega2560 Folder:**
        Contains the image of the main Sailfish firmware. All magic lives here and makes your printer do things... unimaginable things.
